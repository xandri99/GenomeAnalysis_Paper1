# Genome Analysis
### This project represents a reproduction of the publication under the name "RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum".


Basic analysis:
- [x] Reads preprocessing: trimming + quality check (before and after)
- [x] Genome assembly with PacBio reads.
- [x] Assembly quality evaluation.
- [x] Structural and functional annotation.
- [x] RNA-Seq reads alignment against the assembled genome.
- [x] Synteny comparison with a closely related genome.
- [x] Differential expression analysis between rich medium and heat-inactivated serum conditions.


Extra analysis:
- [x] Genome assembly with Illumina and Nanopore reads.
- [x] Assembly evaluation (extra methods).
- [ ] Plasmid identification.
- [ ] SNPs calling.
- [ ] Evaluate antibiotic resistance potential.
- [ ] Identify essential genes for growth in human serum based on the Tn-Seq data analysis.
