# Genome Analysis
## RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum.


Process:
* Reads preprocessing: trimming + quality check (before and after)
* Genome assembly with PacBio reads.
* Assembly quality evaluation.
* Structural and functional annotation.
* Synteny comparison with a closely related genome.
* Differential expression analyses
